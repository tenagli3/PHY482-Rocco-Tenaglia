## Assignment 1

Rocco, I think that your proposal is a good one. Gauge theories are incredibly important to theoretical physics and we are unlikely to dig into them very much in our course unless the class chooses to study it later in the semester. The papers that you have are readily accessible to introduce this work. My suggestion would be to read the chapter on Gauge theory in Griffiths and then read the Jackson article from AJP. Taken together, they can form your summary for this week. The Review articles by Jackson is probably also a very good one to read before didding into the historical literature, but I find review articles tend to be quite long and dense, so we can hold off on that one until you feel like you've gotten your footing with these first two readings. I'm exicted to see what you develop from this. Great work!
