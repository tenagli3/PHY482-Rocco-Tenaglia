## Assignment 3

Rocco, the paper that you summarized this week looks very interesting, but it left me wondering how it related to your overall paper. I think it's interesting to think about the historical development of the thoery and if that's what you are doing, that's very cool (and appropriate). If you are instead trying to do something else, I suspect that you are going to to need to read an additional paper before trying to synthesize what you have read into a coherent narrative for this week. I would have liked to see how you see this relating to what you have done so far. In any event, what I will be looking for this week is that you are trying to provide a coherent narrative to what you have read and enough detail for it to be clear what you have learned from these papers.

## Assignment 2

Rocco, it appears that the Griffith's chapter and the Jackson article were well worth your time. That's great. Your summaries are nice, but they are a bit overviewy. I'd hope that next week you start to dig into the details of these and other articles as you start to develop your paper. You will need to be able to explain the underlying mathematical models to these transformations and their implications. It will also be important to relate them to physical phenomenon. My suggestion would be to read papers related to either of those to get a better footing around how these transformations get used and what they help us describe. Good work so far, but let's dig a bit deeper for next week.

## Assignment 1

Rocco, I think that your proposal is a good one. Gauge theories are incredibly important to theoretical physics and we are unlikely to dig into them very much in our course unless the class chooses to study it later in the semester. The papers that you have are readily accessible to introduce this work. My suggestion would be to read the chapter on Gauge theory in Griffiths and then read the Jackson article from AJP. Taken together, they can form your summary for this week. The Review articles by Jackson is probably also a very good one to read before didding into the historical literature, but I find review articles tend to be quite long and dense, so we can hold off on that one until you feel like you've gotten your footing with these first two readings. I'm excited to see what you develop from this. Great work!
