# Feedback on Project Work
## Rocco Tenaglia

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 5

Rocco, it appears that you have a ways to go towards a complete draft. I expected this given your ambitious plan. I think the idea you have a good one, but I'm concerned that it might be a lot to put together. The paper is due soon, so trying to get something complete to allow me to provide you with more feedback such as, what is the order and nature of what you intend to present? And how much group theory do you plan to present in order to make your point about gauge theory in EM? Maybe for the second question, minimizing the amount there to allow you time to finish a full draft soon.

## Assignment 4

Rocco, this summary reads more like a plan for your paper, which is completely fine and superhelpful. I think you have laid out an ambitious draft here, but one that seems to illustrate the necessary components of a paper that you can write. I don't have any strong feedback on the structure itself, I think it makes sense. But, what I would very much like to see this week is a draft of some parts of this paper, perhaps, the first two to three sections discussed in the summary you wrote. I want to make sure you aren't biting off too much, but also that you writing on the paper gets some feedback and not just the plan. Great work on the outline here.

## Assignment 3

Rocco, the paper that you summarized this week looks very interesting, but it left me wondering how it related to your overall paper. I think it's interesting to think about the historical development of the thoery and if that's what you are doing, that's very cool (and appropriate). If you are instead trying to do something else, I suspect that you are going to to need to read an additional paper before trying to synthesize what you have read into a coherent narrative for this week. I would have liked to see how you see this relating to what you have done so far. In any event, what I will be looking for this week is that you are trying to provide a coherent narrative to what you have read and enough detail for it to be clear what you have learned from these papers.

## Assignment 2

Rocco, it appears that the Griffith's chapter and the Jackson article were well worth your time. That's great. Your summaries are nice, but they are a bit overviewy. I'd hope that next week you start to dig into the details of these and other articles as you start to develop your paper. You will need to be able to explain the underlying mathematical models to these transformations and their implications. It will also be important to relate them to physical phenomenon. My suggestion would be to read papers related to either of those to get a better footing around how these transformations get used and what they help us describe. Good work so far, but let's dig a bit deeper for next week.

## Assignment 1

Rocco, I think that your proposal is a good one. Gauge theories are incredibly important to theoretical physics and we are unlikely to dig into them very much in our course unless the class chooses to study it later in the semester. The papers that you have are readily accessible to introduce this work. My suggestion would be to read the chapter on Gauge theory in Griffiths and then read the Jackson article from AJP. Taken together, they can form your summary for this week. The Review articles by Jackson is probably also a very good one to read before didding into the historical literature, but I find review articles tend to be quite long and dense, so we can hold off on that one until you feel like you've gotten your footing with these first two readings. I'm excited to see what you develop from this. Great work!
